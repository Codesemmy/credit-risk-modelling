# 🏦 Credit Risk Modeling

This project demonstrates a supervised machine learning approach to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. The goal is to build, evaluate, and interpret models that can help financial institutions assess credit risk.

## 📊 Problem Statement

Credit risk is the possibility of a borrower failing to repay a loan or meet contractual obligations. Accurately predicting credit risk can help financial institutions reduce losses and make better lending decisions.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes borrower information such as:
- Credit history
- Loan amount
- Employment status
- Income
- Age
- Previous defaults
- Purpose of the loan


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy (data preprocessing)
- Scikit-learn (modeling)
- XGBoost / LightGBM (optional advanced models)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualizations)
- Jupyter Notebook
